    <h1>Sight Assistant for the Blind</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Sight Assistant for the Blind</strong> is a full-stack wearable web-based solution
        designed to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings safely
        and independently. The system combines object detection, obstacle alerts, and voice-based
        assistance to provide real-time environmental awareness.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This solution uses a wearable device integrated with a web application to detect nearby
        objects and obstacles. When an obstacle is identified, the system provides instant audio
        alerts, helping users avoid collisions and move confidently in both indoor and outdoor
        environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time object detection using smart sensors and vision technology</li>
        <li>Instant obstacle detection and alert system</li>
        <li>Multilingual voice output support (Tamil, English, Hindi)</li>
        <li>Wearable and lightweight design for daily use</li>
        <li>User-friendly web interface for configuration and monitoring</li>
        <li>Reliable and fast response for real-world usage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Multilingual Voice Assistance</h2>
    <p>
        The system supports multilingual voice output, enabling users to receive alerts and
        guidance in Tamil, English, or Hindi. This ensures accessibility for users from diverse
        linguistic backgrounds.
    </p>

    <h2>Purpose and Impact</h2>
    <p>
        The primary goal of this project is to enhance independence, safety, and confidence
        for visually impaired individuals. By providing real-time auditory guidance, the system
        helps users navigate their environment more effectively and reduces reliance on external
        assistance.
